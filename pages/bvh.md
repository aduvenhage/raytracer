# Bounding Volume Hyrarchy

## Building The Hyrarchy
- binary space partitioning
- creating the tree (recursive; recalc bounds after; raw pointers custom allocators)
- walking the tree

## Optimised Hits
- recursive version
- iterative version
- using pointers/nodes vs using a flat binary tree


## Applied to Triangle Meshes
- lambdas are a hit
