# Cloud Runner
I created a python script to automate the docker-machine calls and I also created a CLI version of the raytracer app.
For this cloud runner I also revived an older project of mine (https://github.com/aduvenhage/docker-machine-api) to automate the docker-machine calls.

# Features
- [ ] use docker-machine to create and run remote instances
- [ ] allow using different cloud providers
- [ ] specificy which raytracing scene/scenario to build though the command line
